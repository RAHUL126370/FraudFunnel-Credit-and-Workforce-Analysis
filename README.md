# FraudFunnel-Credit-and-Workforce-Analysis

This project focuses on anomaly detection in credit card transactions using advanced machine learning techniques. It also includes dimensionality reduction through Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and worker funnel analysis. The goal is to provide insights into potential fraudulent activities and reduce the complexity of high-dimensional data.

Features

1. Anomaly Detection:Utilizes trained models to identify fraudulent credit card transactions.
2. Dimensionality Reduction:Employs PCA to reduce the data to its most essential components while retaining 90% of the variance.
3. Worker Funnel Analysis:Analyzes the flow and performance of workers within a funnel structure.
4. Visualization:Comprehensive visualizations to interpret the results and understand the modelâ€™s predictions.

File Descriptions

2. main.ipynb:Integrates different components of the project, including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
3. PCA_interpretation.txt:Provides an interpretation of the PCA results, explaining how the first three principal components capture 90% of the variance.
4. workerfunnel.ipynb:Focuses on analyzing the worker funnel, providing insights into the workflow and performance of workers.
